# AI-Powered Debate Simulator and Media Intelligence Platform

## üöÄ Overview

The AI-Powered Debate Simulator is an advanced NLP platform for analyzing, simulating, and enhancing televised or online debates **before they happen**. Targeted at media professionals, educators, and learners, it offers both media intelligence tools and an interactive, gamified debate environment powered by state-of-the-art AI models.

***

## üí° Features

- **Debate Topic Analysis**: Contextual NLP for relevance, controversy, sentiment, and engagement prediction.
- **Argument Generation**: Automated, balanced pro/con arguments with summarization and online evidence mining.
- **Guest Persona Recommendation**: AI-driven, balanced recommendations for debate panelists or archetypal personas.
- **Gamified Debate Simulator**: Users debate AI agents imitating well-known personalities, scored for reasoning quality and persuasiveness.
- **Media Dashboard**: Analytics for producers and supervisors to develop engaging, balanced debate segments.

## üß© Architecture Overview

| Layer | Technology |
| :-- | :-- |
| Backend | Python, FastAPI (+ Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL) |
| NLP/AI | spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, OpenAI API |
| Database | PostgreSQL, Redis (cache/leaderboard), MongoDB (optional) |
| Frontend | Vue.js 3 (or React), WebSockets (real-time debate) |
| Deployment | Docker, Docker Compose, (optional: Kubernetes) |
| DevOps/CI | GitHub Actions, pytest, flake8, black |


***

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-team/debate-simulator.git
cd debate-simulator
```


### 2. Setup Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download required NLP models:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon'); nltk.download('punkt')"
```


***

### 3. Configuration

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set environment variables (DB creds, API keys).
- Ensure PostgreSQL and Redis are running (use Docker for dev ease).

***

### 4. Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access:

- API: `http://localhost:8000`
- Producer/Simulator UI: `http://localhost:8080` (Adjust port for frontend)

## üìà How to Contribute

1. **Branch from `main`**, use feature branches (`feature/<name>`)
2. **Commits:** Clear, with issue references and concise messages
3. **Pull Requests:** One reviewer required before merge
4. **Tests:** All new code requires matching unit or integration tests
5. **Documentation:** Update `README.md` and in-code comments as you add features

***

## üß™ Testing

```bash
pytest --cov=backend
```

CI runs on push/PR via GitHub Actions with lint, tests, and coverage badges.

***

## üîí Security

- All endpoints use JWT auth
- Use HTTPS and .env for all secrets in prod
- Rate limits on public endpoints (Redis)

***

## üì¶ Deployment

- Built-in `docker-compose.yml` for simple local dev start
- Modular for advanced cloud deployment (K8s, AWS, etc.)
